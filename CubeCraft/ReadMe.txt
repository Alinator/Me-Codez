Please put the cpp files in the source folder, and the header files in the header folder of 
your project.
The image file ship, needs to be put where all of the source code is available.


How to play:
1) put in the source code in a SDL configured project.
2) build
3) run
4) pretty much, KEEP SHOOTING UNTIL YOU GET TIRED! You shoot with space and move the cube with the arrows.
One thing to note here is that you cant die and you have infinite ammunition.


HAPPY PLAYING..i hope :P
