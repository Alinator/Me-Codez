Group I
Step by Step 
Gps Navigation System

This software has been developed by Group I of IT university in Gothenburg university.
A group of students stydying at IT university, which comprise of:

Dmitry Igoshin
Kirill Blazhko
Johan W Schutzer
Sebastian Hansson
Mahsa Mirtalebi

This software is not for sale or for sell at retail level. This is free open source system, that can be 
downloaded by anyone for free, without any charge, as agreed within Group I.

*****************************TO RUN THE JAR FILE******************************

1 ) open up command line.
2 ) cd towards the directory in which you have stored the jar file.its in the submission folder.   
3 ) ones inside the file write: java -jar SBSwithsounds.jar 

******************** HOW TO INSTALL FOR LINUX*********************************
This section is specifically for how to run the software on the Linux platform. Please note that 
the software can only be run on windows and Linux operative systems. Any try on running the system on a 
Mac operative may result in complete failure or maybe that some parts of the software dont function properly.

The software will run good on Linux, however the things that you as a user have to do, in order to recieve 
coordinates and see you position on the map, while running the system inside Linux is the following:

open the Linux file and choose i686-unknown-linux-gnu. Inside of it you will find :

librxtxParallel.so
librxtxSerial.so

copy theese files inside /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0/jre/lib/i386/

and you can also choose a different librxtxSerial.so depending on what system you are running as available
inside of Linux file.

FINAL STEP:
now copy the RXTXcomm.jar into the following link /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0/jre/lib/ext/

the file path may vary on your computer so please adjust it accordingly.

**************************** HOW TO INSTALL FOR WINDOWS **************************************

Same as for Linux, the only setting that has to be made is for the recieving of coordinates.
the system will work properly after the following settings:

Choose your binary build - x64 or x86 (based on which version of
the JVM you are installing to)

NOTE: You MUST match your architecture.  You can't install the i386
version on a 64-bit version of the JDK and vice-versa.

For a JDK installation:

Copy RXTXcomm.jar ---> <JAVA_HOME>\jre\lib\ext
Copy rxtxSerial.dll ---> <JAVA_HOME>\jre\bin
Copy rxtxParallel.dll ---> <JAVA_HOME>\jre\bin

************************ PROGRAM FUNCTIONALITY *********************************************

Make sure that you have a folder named "routes" in the same folder as the jar file.
It's ok if it's empty.
Make sure that you have a file "placeinputs.txt" in the same folder as the jar file.
It's ok if it's empty.


Short about navigation: When a navigation path is displayed, it will
		        get updated every second, from your
			current location to the raget location.
			Sometimes it might display a path that requires
			you to head backwards in the path. Simply
			ignore this and follow the path to the target.
			The program will inform you when your are within
			ten meters from the target.

	   location to this point.

Geocaches: Press this button to go to the geocaches menu. This will first
	   open a file chooser. Pick the .loc file you want to load. A list
	   of the geocaches from the .loc file will be displayed. Pick one
	   to display a path from yoour current location to that geoache.
	   Only one geocache can be selected at once. 

Options: Press this to go the options menu
		Here you can select different options;
		Measuring standard: Display distance in meters or kilometers
		Sound: Turn sound on or off
